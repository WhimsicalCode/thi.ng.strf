# thi.ng/strf

A micro library providing a Clojure/Clojurescript compatible and
extensible string & date formatters and a number of number parser
helper functions. This library is the result of a thi.ng projectwide
restructuring / dissolving of the [thi.ng/common](http://thi.ng/common) library.

*Note:* This library relies on the new conditional reader syntax of
 recent Clojure & Clojurescript versions and therefore is **not
 compatible with Clojure versions < 1.7.0**

Please see [index.org](src/index.org) for further information.
